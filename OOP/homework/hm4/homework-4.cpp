/*
    Exercise: Employee Management System

    You are tasked with creating an employee management system for a company. 
    Each employee has a name, age, position, and salary. 
    Your goal is to implement a class called Employee that encapsulates 
    these attributes and provides appropriate setters and getters.

    Your task is to create a C++ class called Employee with the following specifications:

    1. Private member variables:
        name (string): Holds the name of the employee.
        age (int): Holds the age of the employee.
        position (string): Holds the position/title of the employee.
        salary (double): Holds the salary of the employee.
    
    2. Public member functions:
        setName(const string& name): Sets the name of the employee.
        setAge(int age): Sets the age of the employee.
        setPosition(const string& position): Sets the position of the employee.
        setSalary(double salary): Sets the salary of the employee.
        getName() const: Returns the name of the employee.
        getAge() const: Returns the age of the employee.
        getPosition() const: Returns the position of the employee.
        getSalary() const: Returns the salary of the employee.
    
    Your implementation should allow external code to set and get the attributes of
    an Employee object using the appropriate setter and getter functions.

    Here's a code template to get you started:
*/

class Employee {
    private:
        string name;
        int age;
        string position;
        double salary;

    public:
        // TODO: Implement setters and getters
        void setName(const string& name) {
            this->name = name;
        }

        void setAge(int age) {
            this->age = age;
        }

        void setPosition(const string& position) {
            this->position = position;
        }

        void setSalary(double salary) {
            this->salary = salary;
        }

        string getName() const {
            return name;
        }

        int getAge() const {
            return age;
        }

        string getPosition() const {
            return position;
        }

        double getSalary() const {
            return salary;
        }

};


int main() {

    // TODO: Test the Employee class by creating an object, setting attributes, and getting attribute values
    Employee emp;
    emp.setName("John Doe");
    emp.setAge(30);
    emp.setPosition("Software Engineer");
    emp.setSalary(75000.0);

    cout << "Employee Details:" << endl;
    cout << "Name: " << emp.getName() << endl;
    cout << "Age: " << emp.getAge() << endl;
    cout << "Position: " << emp.getPosition() << endl;
    cout << "Salary: $" << emp.getSalary() << endl;
    return 0;
}
